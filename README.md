# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023

## Semantic Verioning :mage:

This project is going to utilize semantic verioning for its tagging.
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)

The general format:

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, eg. `1.0.1`

- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.


## Install the Terraform CLI

### Considerations with the Terraform CLI changes
The Terraform CLI installation instructions have changes due to gpg keyring changes. So we need to refer to the latest install CLI 
instruction via Terraform Documentation and change the installation script.

### Consideratrions for Linux Distribution

This project is built against Ubunut.
Please consider checking your Linux Distribution and change accordingly to the distribution requirements.

[How To Check OS Version in Linux](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-check-os-version-in-linux-command-line/)

Example of checking OS Version:

```
$ cat /etc/os-release 
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS"
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION_ID="22.04"
VERSION="22.04.4 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"
VERSION_CODENAME=jammy
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"
UBUNTU_CODENAME=jammy
```

### Refactoring into Bash Scripts

While fixing the Terraform CLI gpg depreciation issues we notice that bash script steps were a considerable amount of code. So we decided to create a bash script file to install Terrform CLI.

This bash script is located here: [./bin/install_terraform_cli](./bin/install_terraform_cli)

- This willkeep the Gitpod Task File ([.gitpod.yml](.gitpod.yml)) tidy.
- This allow an easier debugging and excute manually Terraform CLI install
- This will allow better portability fro other projects that need to install Terraform CLI.

### Shebang Considerations

A Shebang (prounced Sha-bang) tells the bash script which program that will interpret the script. eg. `#!/bin/bash`

ChatGPT recommended this format for bash: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`

- For portability for different OS distributions
- Will search the user's PATH for the bash executable

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)

#### Execution Considerations

When executing the bash script we can use the `./` shorthand notation to execute the bash script.
 eg. `./bin/install_terraform_cli`

If we are using a script in .gitpod.yml we need to point the script to a program to interpret it.

eg. `source ./bin/install_terraform_cli`

#### Linux Permissions Considerations

In order to make the bash scripts executable we need to change Linux permissions for the file to be executable by the user.

```sh
chmod u+x ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```
alternatively:

```sh
chmod 744 ./bin/install_terraform_cli
```

### Github Lifecycle (Before, Init, Command)

We need to be careful when using the Init because it will not rerun if we restart an existing workspace.

https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks


### Working Env Vars

#### env command

We can list out all Environment Variables (Env Vars) using the `env` command

We can filter specific env vars using grep eg. `env | grep AWS_`

#### Setting and Unsetting Env Vars

In the terminal we can set using `export HELLO='world`

In the terniaml we unset using `unset HELLO`

We can set an env var temporarily when just running a command

```sh
HELLO='world' ./bin/print_message
```

Within a bash script we can set env without writing export eg.

```
HELLO='world'

echo $HELLO
```
#### Printing Vars

We can print an env using echo eg. `echo $HELLO`

#### Scoping of Env Vars

When you open up new bash terminals in VSCode it will not be aware of env vars that you have set in another window.

If you want to Env Vars to persist across all future bash terminals that are open you need to set env vars in your bash profile. eg. `.bash_profile`


#### Persisting Env Vars in Gitpod

We can persist env vars into gitpod by storing them in Gitpod Secrets Storage.

```
gp env HELLO='world'
```

All future workspaces launched will set the env vars for all bash terminals opened in thoes workspaces.

You can also set en vars in the `.gitpod.yml` but this can only contain non-senstive env vars.
