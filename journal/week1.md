# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023 - Week 1

## Root Module Structure

Our root module structure is as follows:

```
- PROJECT_ROOT
  |-- main.tf             # everything else
  |-- variables.tf        # stores the structure of input variables
  |-- terraform.tfvars    # the data variables we want to load to our Terraform project
  |-- providers.tf        # define required providers and their configuration
  |-- outputs.tf          # stores our outputs
  |-- README.md           # required for root modules

```

## Terraform and Input Variables

### Terraform Cloud Variables

In terraform we can set two kind of variables:

- Enviroment Variables - those you would set in your bash terminal eg. AWS credentials
- Terraform Variables - those that you would normally set in your tfvars file

We can set Terraform Cloud variables to be sensitive so they are not shown visibliy in the UI.

### Loading Terraform Input Variables

[Terraform Input Variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables)

### var flag

We can use the `-var` flag to set an input variable or override a variable in the tfvars file eg. `terraform -var user_ud="my-user_id"`

### var-file flag

Terraform allows you to define variable files called `*.tfvars` to create a reusable file for all the variables for a project. 

[var file ](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/terraform-redhat/rhcs/latest/docs/guides/terraform-vars)

in CLI  we can provide multiple var files as input as follow:

```sh
terraform plan -var-file="variables.tfvars" -var-file="additional_variables.tfvars
```


### terraform.tfvars

This is the default file to load in terraform variables in blunk

### auto.tfvars

`auto.tfvars` is a special filename that Terraform automatically loads variable values from, if present in the current working directory. This file allows you to define default values for your variables without explicitly passing them via the command line or specifying them in your configuration files.


### order of terraform variables

Terraform loads variables in the following order, with later sources taking precedence over earlier ones:

[Variable Definition Precedence](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#variable-definition-precedence)

- Environment variables
- The `terraform.tfvars` file, if present.
- The `terraform.tfvars.json` file, if present.
- Any `*.auto.tfvars` or `*.auto.tfvars.json` files, processed in lexical order of their filenames.
- Any `-var` and `-var-file` options on the command line, in the order they are provided. (This includes variables set by a Terraform Cloud workspace.)


## Dealing With Configuration Drift

### What happens if we lose our state file?

If you lose your statefile, you most likley have to tear down all your cloud infrastructure manually.

You can use terraform port but it won't for all cloud resources. You need check the terraform providers documentation for which resources support import.

### Fix Missing Resources with Terraform Import

`terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket bucket-name`

[AWS S3 Bucket Import](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket#import)

Terraform Import](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import)

### Fix Manual Configuration

If someone goes and delete or modifies cloud resource manually through ClickOps.

If we run Terraform plan it will attempt to put our infrstraucture back into the expected state fixing Configuration Drift.

## Fix using Terraform Refresh 

```sh
terraform apply -refresh-only --auto-approve
```

## Terraform Modules

### Terraform Module Structure

It is recommended to place modules in a `modules` directory when locally developing modules but you can name it whatever you like.

### Passing Input Variables

We can pass input variables to our module.
The module has to declare the terraform variables in its own variables.tf

```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  source = "./modules/terrahouse_aws"
  user_uuid = var.user_uuid
  bucket_name = var.bucket_name
}
```

### Modules Sources

Using the source we can import the module from various places eg:
- locally
- Github
- Terraform registry

```tf
module "terrahouse_aws" {
  source = "./modules/terrahouse_aws"
}
```

## Considerations when using ChatGPT to write Terraform
LLMs such as ChatGPT may not be trained on the latest documentation or information about Terraform.

It is likely to produce older examples that may be deprecated. Often affects providers.

## Working with Files in Terraform

### File exists function

This is a built in terraform function to check the existance of a file.

```tf
condition = fileexists(var.error_html_filepath)
```
https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/fileexists

### Filemd5

https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/filemd5

### Path Variable

In terraform there is a special variable called path that allows us to reference local paths:
- path.module = get the path for the current module
- path.root = get the path for the root module Special Path Variable

resource "aws_s3_object" "index_html" { bucket = aws_s3_bucket.website_bucket.bucket key = "index.html" source = "${path.root}/public/index.html" }

### Terraform Locals

Locals allows us to define local variables. It can be very useful when we need transform data into another format and have referenced a variable.

```tf
locals {
  s3_origin_id = "MyS3Origin"
}
```

[Local Values](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/locals)

### Terraform Data Sources

This allows use to source data from cloud resources.

This is useful when we want to reference cloud resources without importing them.

```tf
data "aws_caller_identity" "current" {}

output "account_id" {
  value = data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id
}
```
[Data Sources](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/data-sources)

### Working with JSON

We use the jsonencode to create the json policy inline in the hcl.

```tf
 jsonencode({"hello"="world"})
{"hello":"world"}
```

[jsonencode](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/functions/jsonencode)

### Changing the Lifecycle of Resources

[Meta Arguments Lifcycle](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/meta-arguments/lifecycle)

### Terraform Data

Plain data values such as Local Values and Input Variables don't have any side-effects to plan against and so they aren't valid in replace_triggered_by. You can use terraform_data's behavior of planning an action each time input changes to indirectly use a plain value to trigger replacement.

## Provisioners

Provisioners allow you to execute commands on compute instances eg. a AWS CLI command.

They are not recommended for use by Hashicorp because Configuration Management tools such as Ansible are a better fit, but the functionality exists.

[Provisioners](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/syntax)

### Local-exec

This will execute commands on the machine running the terraform commands (e.g. local machine) eg. plan apply

```tf
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo The server's IP address is ${self.private_ip}"
  }
}
```

[local-exec](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/local-exec)

### Remote-exec

This will execute commands on a machine which you target. You will need to provide credentials such as ssh to get into the machine.

```tf
resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  # ...

  # Establishes connection to be used by all
  # generic remote provisioners (i.e. file/remote-exec)
  connection {
    type     = "ssh"
    user     = "root"
    password = var.root_password
    host     = self.public_ip
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "puppet apply",
      "consul join ${aws_instance.web.private_ip}",
    ]
  }
}
```

[remote-exec](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/provisioners/remote-exec)

## For Each Expressions

For each allows us to enumerate over complex data types

```sh
[for s in var.list : upper(s)]
```

This is mostly useful when you are creating multiple cloud resources and you want to reduce the amount of repetitive terraform code.
